Mini project Fast-Food billing management system web app under software engineering course where i had written SRS document for the mini project describing the Data-flow diagram, class diagram, Use case diagram, Entity-Relationship diagram, sequence diagram. Then i started coding part in JAVA programming language using MVC architectural pattern, MySQL database and Apache HTTP server. The project was designed aimed at easing the rush at the College canteen. OOPs concepts were extensively used for the coding of the project. The ER diagram was key in proper integration of database with the web app. The web app can take one customers orders in sequence or remove it, produce total bill and return a pdf of the bill which is to be printed or forwarded to customer's email and also provided customer loyality tokens of discount based on number of visits in a week.
